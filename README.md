Blockchain & Web3 Security Research

In this repository I collect my findings as part of the Bug Bounty programs.

Vulnerabilities found:

* **[Argument Injection in Nubank Vessel](https://github.com/rdin777/vessel-security-research)** — Security audit of a Clojure-based container management tool. Identified unsanitized input vectors in CLI arguments that could lead to RCE in CI/CD pipelines.

CSWSH (Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking) — Backpack Exchange.

IDOR / Data Injection — Analytics endpoints (Amplitude).

Tools: Python, Requests, Burp Suite.

### 🚀 Recent Contributions (L2 Marathon)

#### 1. Arbitrum (Offchain Labs) — Node Integrity
* **Issue:** Prevented database corruption during node reorgs ([#4098](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/issues/4098)).
* **Solution:** Implemented pre-initialization state validation in `cmd/nitro/init.go` (PR [#4163](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/nitro/pull/4163)).
* **Impact:** Eliminated risks of "bricking" nodes during rollbacks, protecting operator databases from inconsistency.


#### 2. Linea (Consensys) — ZkTracer Architecture
* **Issue:** Fixed decoupling of line counts from trace height in arithmetic modules (Issue #1955).
* **Solution:** Refactored `computeLineCount()` logic in Java-based tracers to support dynamic complexity.
* **Impact:** Ensured stable proof generation and eliminated "silent errors" in trace files.


#### 3. ZKsync Era — Prover & CI Optimization
* **Contribution:** Refactored magic constants into named parameters to improve system auditability (PR #1230).
* **Action:** Optimized GitHub Actions for the core proof generation pipeline to speed up CI/CD cycles.
* **Result:** Enhanced code maintainability and transparency for the prover infrastructure.
